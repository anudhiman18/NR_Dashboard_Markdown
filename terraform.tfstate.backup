Options are Accepted, Not Accepted. Manual Review.\r\n4. If Accepted or h Review, Payment Service rakes a request to MESH Platform via Internal API ana aSkS MESH to create the order with the correct Status (Paid. In Review, etc.)\r\n5. MESH Platform creates the order and also writes it to RabbitMQ which sits on the Kubernetes RabbitMQ is written to so that data can be sent to various systems such as MESH Metrics and ClastiSearch (used by MESH Control).\r\n6. MESH Platform then respmas back to the Payment Service via Internal API to confirm that the order has been created.\r\n7. Payment Service then tells the new Checkout that the order has been created and the customer won be Shown the Order Cmfimation Page.\r\n8. It was in review in step 3, once review is comoted, Adyen will send callback to Kubernetes endpoint ana NOT the new payment service. This message then goes to the SCS queue and those messages Will be sent to the notifications endpoint on the Payment Serviceto be ncessed.

Apps go through the same process but talk to Payment Service directly via the hostname https://paymentservice.eks.jdgroupmesh.cloud which is public.\r\n \r\n---\r\n#### At point 6. the payment service and the new checkout only wait for 25 seconds for a response from MESH Platform. Any longer than this and the customer will see a 'Redirection Error' error message and point 7 will never happen.\r\n---\r\n#### Other points to note\r\n• NO gerwire reuests to endpoint Stnuid be blOCked. This endpoint is used by the Payment Inqestor Service (SCS Queue) which can be seen here to notify the Pavrent Ot any Adyen and Mdpay/Razerpay CaUböCkS.
